        <h2>Simple and efficient!</h2>
        French crêpes are good for weekend breakfasts, or even for desserts. Serve rolled up and filled with jam or fruit and 
        whipped cream.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Sift flour, sugar, and salt into a bowl; set aside. Beat eggs and milk together in a large bowl with an electric mixer.
            Beat in flour mixture until smooth; stir in melted butter.</li>
            <li>Lightly grease a griddle or frying pan; heat over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 2 tablespoons for each crêpe. Immediately rotate the 
            skillet to spread batter out in a thin layer. Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the bottom has 
            turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Shake the pan or loosen with a spatula; turn or flip it over and cook until other 
            side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
        </ol>
