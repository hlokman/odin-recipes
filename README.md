Project: Recipes

As a part of TOP courses I made this little project (Project : Recipes) using my knowledges of HTML that I learned so far. Using:
-Boilerplate
-Textes and lists
-Links and images
with severals HTML elements.

The project's goal was to create a basic HTML website with (at least) 3 recipes that we chose. 

I was also able to use Git correctly as best as I could with my current level. I did my best to commit every time I made a meaningful change in the code (and so to commit at every important steps).
